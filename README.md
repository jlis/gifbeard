### Installation

To download all dependencies just run:

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Get started

Create a **config/default.json** config file from the sample config and adjust the properties as you like.
For example the *host* and *port* properties hold the information which ip and port the server binds himself to.

After doing that, simply start the server by running:

```sh
$ npm start
```
